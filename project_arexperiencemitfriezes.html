					<h1>AR Experience<br>
						MIT Friezes</h1>
					<p>For the final project in Mobile Operating Systems and Applications (CSCI E-76), a course taken
						through <a href="https://www.extension.harvard.edu/">Harvard Extension School</a>, I was part of
						a two-person team to create an AR application to provide information about historic scientists
						and engineers whose names were inscribed on a series of friezes along the top of buildings
						around MIT's central Killian Court.<br><b>Role:&nbsp;&nbsp;Concept Originator, Partner Developer</b></p>
				</header>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/fmod7_large.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>So often people walk by buildings with inscribed names but do not know what those names represent. As
					our final
					project in Mobile Operating Systems and Applications class, a partner and I created an iOS iPhone
					app which could be
					pointed at friezes on buildings around Killian Court, and provide images and information about the
					personages
					inscribed in stone.</p>
				<p>The app was location-based, so would only work around Killian Court. Users could look at the friezes
					through their
					iPhones and get a clickable image, which retrieved information about groups and individuals depicted
					on the frieze.
				</p>
				<p>Having taught iPhone/iOS development classes the previous year, I was able to use knowledge of <a
						href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> and <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective-C</a>.</p>

				<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
				<div class="row">
					<div>
						<ul class="alt">
							<li>Help conceive of the concept</li>
							<li>Help develop the augmented reality (AR) capabilities, without the use of ARKit</li>
							<li>Develop Objective-C iOS functionality to use iPhone location and orientation to identify
								which frieze was being
								referenced by the user</li>
							<li>Conduct research of the images of the people inscribed on the friezes, have artwork
								created as caricatures, both
								as individuals and groups, and format the completed artwork</li>
							<li>Create a compass feature to orient the user and aid them in locating the friezes in
								Killian Court</li>
						</ul>
