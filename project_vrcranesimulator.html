					<h1>VR Crane Simulator<br>
						Packet39</h1>
					<p>As part of <a href="https://xrterra.com/programs/developer/">XR Terra AR & VR Developer
							Certificate Program</a>, we had the opportunity to work with a proven high-tech solution
						provider <a href="https://packet39.com/">Packet39</a>. Given the problem of creating a crane
						simulator in VR and collecting relevant performance measurements, we needed to model the physics
						of the crane, create controls for an operator seated in the cab, and map use of the controls to
						movements of the crane in VR.<br><b>Role:&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Lead, Lead Developer</b></p>

				<p>This VR experience is a prototype simulator for training an operator to control a crane on a job site
					to perform
					tasks. Virtual reality is an important training tool, to provide an environment to train which is
					safer and less
					expensive than an actual crane. In it, the user is seated in a cab of a crane and presented with
					four levers and two
					buttons. After tapping a button which serves as an ignition, the user can manipulate one lever to
					rotate the cab;
					the user rotates with the cab. Other levers control boom elevation, sub boom extension, and lowering
					and raising a
					magnetic hook. The magnet is turned on and off with another button.</p>
				<p>In the simulation the user is tasked with controlling the crane to pick up a load and place it in an
					elevated target
					position. Performance measures of speed and accuracy are provided to the user at the end of the
					simulation.</p>
				<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
				<div class="row">
					<div>
						<ul class="alt">
							<li>As Team Lead, led daily meetings with outlined agendas, kept a calendar, and updated the
								Tello board</li>
							<li>Broke down needed functionality into tasks to implement</li>
							<li>Helped initially shape crucial content and structure in the design document</li>
							<li>Helped prepare critical questions for the client</li>
							<li>Worked out the 3D physics in Unity both to replicate controls and the consequential
								movements of a crane</li>
							<li>Enabled crane to have a magnetic hook to pick up and transport loads</li>
							<li>Incorporated metrics on successful placement, and time taken to complete the task, and
								presented information tothe user at the end of the task</li>
							<li>Created controls to rotate the cab left or right, raise or lower the boom, extend or
								retract the sub boom, and lower and raise the hook.</li>
							<li>Created a button to act as an ignition switch which needed to be pressed to start and
								end the activity, and which enabled the other controls</li>
							<li>Created a button to serve as a magnet on the hook, to pick up and release the load</li>
							<li>Helped integrate setting materials</li>
							<li>Helped to integrate sound effects accompanying button pressing, as well as for each of
								the four level controls</li>
							<li>Displayed instructions to the user which could be referenced throughout the simulation
								by looking up</li>
							<li>Worked on hand posture and movement to activate levers in VR</li>
