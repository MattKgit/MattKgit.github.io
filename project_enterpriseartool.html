					<h1>Enterprise AR Tool<br>
						PTC</h1>
					<p>As part of <a href="https://xrterra.com/programs/developer/">XR Terra AR & VR Developer
							Certificate Program</a>, we had the opportunity to work on a real-life problem with industry
						partner <a href="https://www.ptc.com/en">PTC</a> , an industry leader in Enterprise AR. For our
						solution, our team created a mobile AR application entitled ImpARt, which was capable of logging
						and recalling location-based information in a manufacturing setting, with persistent images,
						text, and 3D spatial markers, from a worker's cell phone.<br><b>Role:&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Lead, Lead Developer</b></p>

				<p>Based on a real world enterprise use case, I led a team to design and implement a solution to a
					problem: In a manufacturing setting, persistance of information is key. Issues arise at one time
					that need to be successfully communicated to others at a later time. Issues may have properties like
					time, priority, category etc.; and can be supported by photographs associated with accurate 3D
					marker in AR. Our tool allowed a user to scan a target situated in a known location in relation to a
					machine, then create issues which could then be recalled at a later time, again by scanning the same
					target. The idea was to capitalize on what workers were likely already familar - taking photographs
					with a cell phone. Using our application, a user could take a photo then add a descriptive caption.
					At the time each photo was taken, a 3D marker was created, pointing at the spot where the user took
					the photo. The user was able to adjust the 3D marker in space. Later a user could view the 3D
					markers in AR for a particular issue. Tapping on a marker recalled the photo and capture associated
					with that marker.</p>
