					<h1>Principled Text Viewing<br>in VR<br>Capstone Project</h1>
					<p>Basic to interaction in Virtual Reality is the need
						to read text, but reading text is often a challenge in VR. Often times a user must contort or
						move in order to read
						a piece of text. Sometimes the text must be moved or reoriented by the user. My capstone project
						in the <a href="https://xrterra.com/programs/developer/">XR Terra AR & VR Developer Certificate
							Program</a> was an
						exploration
						to address the difficulties of reading text in VR, by uncovering and implementing principled
						ways of supporting
						reliable text viewing in VR.</p>
				</header>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/principledtextviewing_large.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>Many factors affect a user's ability to read in VR. These include resolution, distance, orientation
					of the text,
					orientation of the user, size of the text, font choice, contrast with the background, color, reading
					angles, and
					required movement by the user. Ignoring these factors can create illegible text, discomfort for the
					user, and a lag
					in the user attempting to read.</p>
				<p><b>Virtually Reality experiences do not universally suport easy reading of moderate-to-long passages.
						What can be done to improve the experience of reading in VR?</b></p>
				<p>Whether text is at a far distance like a billboard, a medium distance like a sign, or a close
					distance like a
					document, users want it readable. Users could be given the choice to scale the text to the most
					comfortable size for
					reading. <b>The text can maintain the same angular size independent of distance.</b></p>
				<p>Users are able to read text passages of certain widths/angles simply by moving their eyes, without
					moving their
					necks or bodies. <b>The width of a text passage can be controlled to minimize unintended
						movement.</b></p>
				<p>Users comfortably tilt their heads down while reading, with their eyes slightly titled up; generally
					averaging about six degrees below the horizon. <b>Text can be angled for actual reading posture.</b>
				</p>
				<p>In traditional text media like books, users turn pages once in a while. Electronic 2D media often
					requires the user to
					scroll a long passage. It is possible to eliminate the need for scrolling in VR that requires grand
					body movements,
					and minimize learned gestures. <b>Text can be parsed into readable chunks, and paged forward or
						backward by a single
						squeeze of the left or right hand respectively.</b> Essentially a slight squeeze can "turn a
					page". Displaying a page count
					is important so users know how far they are into a passage. Scrollbars do generally have the
					advantage of giving a user
					a sense of placement in a passage.</p>
				<p>In VR, we have the ability to change the rules of reality. Rather than requiring the user to move or
					to move a piece
					of text to read, <b>we can have the text always face the user.</b></p>
				<p>When using Unity to create Virtual Reality experiences, it is best to use <b>TextMesh Pro (TMP)</b>.
					Any font can be
					converted into
					a TextMesh Pro asset in Unity. This creates a high resolution font atlas, and uses
					<a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf">SDF
						rendering</a> to provide
					clear characters across a wide range of scaling. <b>Choosing a easy to read font, and a relatively
						simple topography</b>,
					like <a href="https://medium.com/@jaimie.bautista/ty-roboto-9244ce6343a5">roboto</a> <b> yields good
						results.</b></p>
				<p>Color of the font and background should contrast to aid readibility. With nearly 10% of the
					population having color
					blindness, grayscale is a generally good choice, of course there is <a
						href="https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-for-the-eyes-a-white-background-with-black-text-a-black-background-with-white-text-or-sepia-mode">research</a>
					and opinions. From samples of other VR experiences, light gray on dark gray was comfortably
					readable. It was chosen
				</p>
				<p>Comfortable reading of medium-to-long passages of text may be faciliated by having text maintain the
					same
					angular size independent of distance, face the user, adopt a comfortable tilted viewing angle, and
					have a limit of
					the angle/width of a passage to eliminate unnecessary neck and body movements. TextMesh Pro text,
					with a good font
					choice, and comfortable color contrast keeps text easy to read. Implementing a means of paging text
					to minimize
					unnecessary movement and gestures is useful for allowing a person to read without too much movement.
				</p>
				<p>To save on processing and posssible flicker, updating the angular size should only be done when there
					is a
					significant change in distance, which experientially seems to be about .1 meters. Similarly having
					the text face the
					user need only be updated when the user moves significantly. Adjusting the tilt of the text can be
					done when there
					is a significant change in the head up/down movement.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div>
						<ul class="alt">
							<li>Researched, designed, and developed a functional demonstration of the above findings in
								Unity for the Oculus Quest</li>
							<li>Text scales based on distance from the text</li>
							<li>Text always faces the user</li>
							<li>Text assumes a comfortable reading tilt</li>
							<li>Text angle and scale update only after significant user movement</li>
							<li>The width of the text body is within an angle of minimal neck movement</li>
							<li>Text is TextMesh Pro, roboto with a font atlas of a high resolution, and grayscale</li>
							<li>Text is presented as pages, with a page count and total, requiring simple squeezing of
								left and right hand controllers to change a page</li>
							<li>A user can comfortably read medium-to-long passages of text in this manner</li>
