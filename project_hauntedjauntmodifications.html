					<h1>Haunted Jaunt 3D Game Modifications<br>
						XR Terra AR & VR Developer Program</h1>
					<p>In the <a href="https://xrterra.com/programs/developer/">XR Terra AR & VR Developer Certificate
							Program</a>, our first group project was to modify a 3D game shell, <a
							href="https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner">John Lemon's
							Haunted Jaunt</a>, adding lots of functionality to make it exciting and fun.<br><b>Role:&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Lead, Lead Developer</b></p>
				</header>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/hj2_large.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>As our first group project of the XR Terra Ar & VR Developer Program, I led a team to add features
					and functionality
					to a 3D game shell. As our first 3D project, intended for playback on a flat screen, we were able to
					use knowledge
					of collisions, game play, sound, lighting, assets, event broadcasting, and more.</p>

				<p>In the game the user played the part of John Lemon, who could be directed around a haunted mansion by
					using the arrow
					keys. The player, as John, needed to avoid being spotted by ghosts, or coming in contact with
					gargoyles before
					making it to a particular room (the game would finish successfully). If the user was spotted by a
					ghost, a siren
					would sound and lighting change, and the ghosts then chased John. If a ghost made contact with John,
					the game would
					end, and John made a noise. Whether getting caught or finishing, the player was given the option to
					play again.</p>
				<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
				<div class="row">
					<div>
						<ul class="alt">
							<li>Modified a 3D game shell, Unity's <a
									href="https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner">John
									Lemon's Haunted Jaunt: 3D Beginner</a></li>
							<li>As Team Lead, led daily meetings, helped defined sets of essential tasks to complete a
								minimal viable product, and more</li>
							<li>Saved the start position and sent the player back to it, after the player selected to
								play again
							<li>Detect collections when the player had contact with a ghost or gargole</li>
							<li>Used raycasting to detect a patrolling ghost spotting the player</li>
							<li>Create waypoints so patrolling ghosts normally moved along set paths on a nav mesh</li>
							<li>Modified the environment by adding lights and doors to increase the number of paths the
								player may traverse to
								complete the game successfully</li>
							<li>Detected when the user had completed the game by arriving in a certain room</li>
							<li>Inserted royalty-free images into picture frames</li>
							<li>Indicated to the user when the character could use a keyboard key to activate something
								in the game - a SPACEBAR press to
								force a piece of furniture out the way; and an "E" key press to open closed door</li>
							<li>Detect collisions with furniture and doors to let the user know they were close enough
								to act upon them</li>
							<li>Addded glowing baker's hats to make ghosts more apparent</li>
							<li>Added a Mini-Map so user can see top-down orthogonal view of the player's location</li>
							<li>Added background sound effects for when the player was caught by a ghost, finished the
								game successfully, etc.</li>
							<li>Implemented a "Red Alert" Game Mode to indicate when the player was "spotted" by a ghost
								(raycasting ) - lighting changed to red, a background siren sound looped, and the ghosts
								begin to chase the player</li>
							<li>Used an event manager to dispatch and listen for events to simplify code</li>
						</ul>
